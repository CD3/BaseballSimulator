# About

`BaseballSimulator` is a python module for simulating the flight of a baseball with spin. It was written for an undergraduate
research project in the Physics Department at Fort Hays State University (in Hays, KS). The project aims to answer the question
of why a curveball appears to "break". The first step was to implement a physics simulation to generate baseball flight
paths, which resulted in `BaseballSimulator`.

It is still being developed to test new ideas.

## Authors

The physics implemented in `BaseballSimulator` was written by two undergraduate students, June Jung and Richardwhitehill. The
original code was rewritten to provide a cleaner API by C.D. Clark III.
